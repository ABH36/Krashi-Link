# Krashi Link Frontend

This folder scaffolds a sample React frontend for Krashi Link. It contains a component-driven layout targeting Farmer/Owner/Admin roles. Files are initial stubs — fill with real implementations.

Quick start:

```powershell
cd "c:/Users/FTT/Desktop/F -ARM/krashi-link-frontend"
npm install
npm start
```

Tailwind/PostCSS integrations are included in package.json devDependencies — run `npx tailwindcss init -p` to generate configuration if needed.
